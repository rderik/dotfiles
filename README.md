# vimrc
just my personal vim configuration

Most of my personal configuration are inspired by the code in [JuneGunn](https://github.com/junegunn configuration)
that you can find [here](https://github.com/junegunn/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc)

If you want to understand what is going on on the vimrc you can use this resource to learn more about vimscript
