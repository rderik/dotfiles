# dotfiles

You can find my personal configuration files (dotfiles).

## Notes

My personal vim configuration were inspired by the code in [JuneGunn](https://github.com/junegunn) configuration
that you can find [here](https://github.com/junegunn/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc). My Config has grown quite a bit
but you can always take only what you need or get some ideas from my configs.

If you want to understand what is going on on the vimrc you can use this resource to learn more about VimScript
